/*
A classic "does it work?" first example for testing that your NodeJS installation is working.

If you need to install Node, go to https://nodejs.org/ and get the latest LTS version.

Use NodeJS to run this script in your console with:
> node 00-hellonode.js

You should see "Hello Node!" print to the console if Node is installed correctly.
*/

console.log("Hello Node!"); //Most of the time, semicolons are optional.
