These are some basic servers written in NodeJS.


If you need to install Node, go to https://nodejs.org/ and get the latest LTS version.
## Working through this example:


Go through the files in numbered order, reading through the headers and the line comments. 

For some files, you'll need to first install Node modules with the Node Package Manager, or npm:

`> npm install <MODULE> [<MODULE>...]`

For each file, you can run the server in the console with:

`> node <FILE>`

Open your browser to `localhost` with various URLs as suggested in the comments to test how it handles HTTP requests. You might also use the `curl` command in another terminal or the Postman API App (https://www.postman.com/downloads/) to send requests and see responses.
